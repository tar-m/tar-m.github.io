    Making a change to a cloud 
    service may often impact, or require coordination with other cloud services, 
    potentially administered by a different entity. 
    Coordinating such changes across cloud services is manual, error-prone and time 
    consuming today because: (1) the full impact of these changes on other services 
    is hard to track and (2) the asynchronous nature of cross-service communication 
    leads to critical bugs during these changes. In this work, we tackle these 
    challenges through ACCORD, a novel middleware for Automated Change COoRDination 
    across independently managed cloud services.

    - <strong>Consistency in geo-replicated cloud storage systems</strong>:<br />

Causal consistency has emerged as an attractive middle-ground to
architecting cloud storage systems, as it allows for high availability
and low latency, while supporting stronger-than-eventual-consistency
semantics. However, causally-consistent cloud storage systems have seen
limited deployment in practice. A key factor is that these systems
employ full replication of all the data in all the data centers (DCs),
incurring high cost. A simple extension of current causal systems to
support partial replication by clustering DCs into rings incurs
availability and latency problems. We propose Karma, the ﬁrst system to
enable causal consistency for partitioned data stores while achieving
the cost advantages of partial replication without the availability and
latency problems of the simple extension.<br />
    <br />
    Key ideas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partial replication, consistency preserving dynamic 
    ring binding<br />
    Tools:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra, YCSB, 
    Java<br />
    Testbed:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRObE<br />

    Cloud Computing. It was also presented during the poster session at the ACM

maintainig a Finding Aid, and making the collection available online. I
also assisted with developing new processes (automated scripts, and
in-house tools) for handling digital collections, including the use of
